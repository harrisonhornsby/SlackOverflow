Running students' deployments
-----------------------------------

First, I download all student repos using cs418repopuller.py

Note that you need to add your SSH key to your github account, and enter the following (with your personal data) into ~/.ssh/config:

	Host github.com
	User git
	Hostname github.com
	PreferredAuthentications publickey
	Port 22
	IdentityFile /location/of/your/rsa/key

To enable easier cloning. Be sure not to point this at your public key. This means you need to enter your password for each repo, but works well enough for now. 

Next, I go into ./demos/CSUSERNAME (e.g., ./demos/jbrunelle/) and deploy the files to a new docker instance running the same image:

	docker run --network nginx-proxy -e VIRTUAL_HOST=jbrunelle.cs518.cs.odu.edu -v /path/to/demos/directory/demos/jbrunelle:/var/www/html jbrunelle/oducs518f16

This creates the student's deployment at jbrunelle.cs518.cs.odu.edu (or whatever the CSUSERNAME.cs518.cs.odu.edu will be).
